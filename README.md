# README

This is a recreation of the demo app that DHH demonstrates on the home page of https://rubyonrails.org/

It includes everything except the portion where he uploads the app to Heroku.

The app was created on an M1 Mac, using RubyMine, with the following:

* RVM

* Ruby version 3.0.4

* Rails version 7.0.3.1

* Sqlite3

* Run the test suite using: bin/rails test

* Start the server using: bin/rails s

* Deployment: that is up to the user

* Enjoy!
